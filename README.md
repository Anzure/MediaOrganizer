# PlexFC
Plex Format Converter scans for movies (and TV show episodes) in your chosen folder(s). If it finds something, then the application will move the identified media files and organize it for you. It was originally created for Plex media servers, but you don't need Plex at all to use it.

**Main features**

* Movie organizing and identifing (in beta stage, works well in most cases)
* TV show episode organizing and identifing (in alpha stage, expect bugs)

**An example**

Let's say you download this video file: Suicide.Squad.2016.720p.WEB-DL.X264.AC3-EVO.mp4

The application will then understand that the video file is a movie and then move it to your chosen movie folder, it will also rename the file and put it in a folder.

Result example path: D:\Movies\Suicide Squad (2016)\Suicide Squad (2016).mp4

**Installation**

* Install Java (if not already installed)
* Download latest PlexFC.jar
* Move PlexFC.jar to a folder if you want
* Run PlexFC.jar (in Java)
